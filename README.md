Zookeeper client written 100% in Rust

This library is intended to be equivalent with the official (low-level) [ZooKeeper][javadoc] client which ships with the official ZK distribution.

I have plans to implement recipes and more complex [Curator][curator] like logic as well, but that takes a lot of time, so pull requests are more than welcome! At the moment only PathChildrenCache is implemented.

## Usage

Put this in your Cargo.toml:

```ini
[dependencies]
zookeeper = "0.8"
```

And this in your crate root:

```rust
extern crate zookeeper;
```

## Examples
Check the [examples][examples] directory

## Feature and Bug Handling
Also if you find a bug or would like to see a feature implemented please raise an issue or send a pull-request.

## Documentation
Documentation is available on the [gh-pages][doc] branch.
